# This is an example of data, we have it sorted but want the output
# generated with desired order of emit:
# ZZZ lines (in order given in this file)
# AAA lines (in order given in this file)
# CCC lines (in order given in this file)
# As you can seen someone has "sorted" the file, we dont want it
# sorted by in order Z A C
#
# For the exercise you can HARD CODE ZZZ will always be first,
# AAA will always be second, etc.
AAA { fc -name jon1.txt ; col -b < jon1.txt }
AAA { fc -name jon2.txt ; col -b < jon2.txt }
CCC { fc -name nancy1.txt ; col -b < nancy1.txt }

ZZZ { fc -name bret1.txt ; col -b < bret1.txt }
