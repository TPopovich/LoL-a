In exercise 12 we convert this powershell program to select lines
into a unix/linux version using 3 different ways to do it.

Choose one of `using head + tail`, using `sed`, or using `AWK`.

If using head and tail, you should grab some paper and work out
some math as a hint...

In class we will do all three ways, in sequence to show how it is done.

Look at file `ps1_select_range_of_lines.ps1.txt` and convert to
a unix/linux function that works the same.
