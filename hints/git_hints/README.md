## gitconfig

We recommend a set of aliases get added to your .gitconfig

### What we install

We like using rcs/scs like commands, e.g. `ci` for checkin or in git-speak `commit` and `co` for git-speak `checkout`
and some enhanced commands we install `logline` and `filesincommit` or (fic).

### How to install

See [`sample .gitconfig snippet`](./sample__.gitconfig.txt)

On Unix/Linux you can do this to add it:

```
cat sample__.gitconfig.txt  >> ~/.gitconfig
```
