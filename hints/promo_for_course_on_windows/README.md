We will have a small training on how to use windows server.

Some system admin skill is useful on both `windows` and `linux`.

We show some good tools on windows:


### robocopy

The next case study  uses 
Robocopy was a tool built by people outside of microsoft.  Microsoft found
it useful and originally included it on the `NT Resource Kit` but it is
so useful that it now ships with all recent versions of windows.

See [robocopy manual page](./robocopy_man_page.txt) for the help docs, generated by running
`robocopy /???` on windows.  NOTE: the convention of many old windows
native programs is to use `/?` for help.  And also support `/???` (three
question marks) to get even more help than `/?` when available.

#### case study use robocopy to cache-files-and-folders
