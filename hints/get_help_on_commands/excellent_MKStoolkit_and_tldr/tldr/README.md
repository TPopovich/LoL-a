Here video on getting help using MKS or tldr web pages to show how to use them:

```

```

Tldr page uses javascript  -and- many orgs will block the javascript,

and if you might not be able to use tldrâ€™s project page, here is a solution: You can download the following "tar" file (tar works on all unix and also windows10 and above).  This download has a folder that holds all English examples, there is a file called pushd.md (markdown format example for the pushd command).

```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JnO8E0DgSPT7vwBZ2tfn2XwiOe3B1U8p/view?usp=sharing
```

That is the tar file that is only 1 MB in size compressed.

This will have 1 folder with markdown format for all commands showing examples:

The previous page shows a sample page of tldr in how it would appear if the browser supports full javascript if it does not work, no problem, just download the above compressed file and "unzip" by right clicking or do this:

```
cd ~ ; mkdir hints

mv tldr_pages.tar.gz hints

tar xzf tld_pages.tar.gz
^------------- to help do this on unix you can just run command make as we have a makefile to extract

```
on Windows just "right click" and extract to your folder
