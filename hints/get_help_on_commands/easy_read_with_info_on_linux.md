Command `man` was the official command getting help on a command. 
You can more easily, and I always use this method myself, which
borrows emacs (it launches the emacs man/info browser to display
linux documents, so many things in emacs might work, which is
why I also recommened to learn a little emacs).

To use info just do `info command`.

To exit INFO you can use classic emacs exit ^x^c (control x and control c)
or a ^C (control c by itself which is installed since using emacs is not
familar to many users).

```
# E.g. look at help on fgrep  using info
info fgrep
```
