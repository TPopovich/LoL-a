## Recipe create a executable script command [PART A] and script to test permissions, and using script and history

In this exercise we are working with an executable "command" script file. 

We created a command but are having trouble running it from the command line, like any
other command in Linux.

If you have not created it yet please do  [part a of this recipe](./003a_permission_on_a_script_to_execute.md).

Next we will start to use Unix/Linux commands: {chmod, chown} and learn how to make  script we created
in part A 
be executable!
