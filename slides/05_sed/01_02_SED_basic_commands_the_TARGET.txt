Basic Sed Commands, the target

Target of Command
The sed command can take a target: where you specify zero, one, or two addresses. An address can be a regular expression describing a pattern, a line number, or a line addressing symbol like $.

 0 Target
If no address is given, then the command is applied to each line.

 1 Target
If there is only one address, the command is applied to any line matching the address if a regex, usually it is a number meaning that line number

 2 Target
If two comma-separated addresses are specified, the command is performed on the first line matching the first address and all succeeding lines up to and including a line matching the second address.

 Not â€“ inverses the Target
When an address is followed by (!), an exclamation mark, it means binary not. The command is applied to all lines that do not match the address.
Example of Command Target
$!d   = delete all lines except the last line.
3d    = delete the third line
1,3d  = delete lines 1-3
