Invoking Sed Commands

Example of Invoking SED on Bash Command line
-n flag for SED
Unless you instruct it not to, sed sends all lines — ones selected or not
to standard output. 

When you use the –n option on the command line, sed sends only certain lines, 
such as those selected by a Print (p) instruction, to standard output.

$ sed -n ‘3,6 p’  my_lines.txt

^--- That will print lines 3-6 of the file.

-f flag for SED 
When you use a lot of sed actions it is hard to specify on the cmd line.
The –f option on the command line, tells sed to read the cmd script
from a file you specify.
We will see AWK has a similar flag as well.
$ echo ‘3,6 p’  > print_lines_3_6.sed
$ sed –n –f print_lines_3_6.sed my_lines.txt
