Quiz: Bash Commands (1)

1) Given an editor like VIM  or just use the command cat use it to display file ~/.bashrc  
Hint: ~ maps to your home directory and specified the filename using a shorthand.
Hint: VIM is an editor we will study later.  Cmd "cat" will display file content to the terminal.

2) After typing the following commands what is the folder after the final step. 
cd /
pwd
cd
pwd
ls

#  Can we figure out what cd by itself does?  Did it go to any folder?

3) Figure what does "cd -" do, do this to experiment:
cd ~
pwd
cd /
pwd
cd -
pwd

# Hint: do another "cd -" and look at the current folder pathname.
#
# What does cd - do?

4) Given the last exercise, explore hidden files, why does command
   ls
not show file .bashrc  (yet we know it is there from exercise 1)?  Do the following to figure:

cd
ls 
[ -f .bashrc ]  ||  echo “file not found”
# if the above works as it does not print file not found.  Q: why?
Look up information by doing 
   info ls
or
   man ls
to discover how to show hidden files
# Hint: ~ maps to your home directory and specified the filename using a shorthand.

5) Redo #1 above showing file content using, cat/less/head to will show file content on terminal
