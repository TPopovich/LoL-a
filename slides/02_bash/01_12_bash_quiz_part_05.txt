Quiz: Bash Commands (5)

1) We did not touch much on functions, but see if you can use
help or the net to lookup bash functions.

2) Using #1 above what does this set of commands do?

```
mkdir -p ~/histories/javier
cat >> ~/histories/javier/stage__ROW1.txt << EOF
stage_1
stage_2
...
EOF

function stages { cat ~/histories/javier/stage__ROW1.txt; }

# in question below what does this do and why might we want it
cat >> ~/.bashrc  <<EOF

function stages { cat ~/histories/javier/stage__ROW1.txt; }

EOF

```

3) In the above example commands we did a cat >> to bashrc
why might we do that, try it what happens?
Think of coming in the next day and launching a new bash what might
happen?
