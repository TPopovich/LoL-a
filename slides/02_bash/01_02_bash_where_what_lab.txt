Bash: Where and What Lab

To learn about a command, how the shell interprets it, and where the executable file is located, use:

type somecommand # tells what kind of file this is
which somebinary  # tells where a program lives

Working with Files and Directories
To display the content of a text file called a_file:

cat a_file
To list the contents of a directory, use ls, and you may wish to further use the output. For example, to count the number of files in a directory, use:

ls -l /etc |  wc –l
# also ls -1 is useful

# Finding files and file content in more detail by using find
find . -type f -exec grep -H FINDME {} \; 2
# the –H will print the filename for each “hit”

find /etc -name "*.conf" 1
# Find files ending in .conf in directory /etc.
