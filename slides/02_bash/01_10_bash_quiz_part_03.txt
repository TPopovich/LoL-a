Quiz: Bash Commands (3)

1) explore stderr  and stdout with ls command
When you do ls on a missing file it will return an error code that you can view by doing echo $? It also writes to stderr or stdout 

 mkdir -p /tmp/123
 cd /tmp/123
 ls fox
 echo $?

 ## -- next just look at the output of the next THREE ls commands
  ls fox > /dev/null               #ls(1)
  ls  fox  2> /dev/null            #ls(2)
  ls  > /dev/null                  #ls(3)

# in the above 3 “ls commands”,  how come only the first ls(1) gave any output?
# Hint:  we are playing with stream redirection so be careful how you enter the commands to match our results
