```
The file vimtutorial.txt is a version of the open source
vimtutorial for users not able to find that on their system.

Emacs long ago had a excellent tutorial (where you follow along
in a file and "edit it" to learn how to use the editor).
File vimtutorial.txt is the same kind of file.

To use it, launch vim/vi on the file and follow along.

NOTE: vim is an enhanced and improved "vi" so if you are using
classic vi some features covered might not be present but most
will be.
